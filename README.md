# AI-Disaster-Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains research and analysis on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in predicting and mitigating natural disasters. The project examines AI applications in different phases of disaster management, including prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to explore AIâ€™s role in disaster management by:
- Analyzing the latest AI models used in predicting and mitigating natural disasters.
- Evaluating the strengths and limitations of AI in disaster response.
- Discussing ethical and practical concerns associated with AI-driven disaster management.

## Research Approach
- **Literature Review:** Reviewing key articles on AI applications in disaster management.
- **Case Studies:** Examining real-world AI implementations for disaster prediction and response.
- **Analysis:** Evaluating AI-based models used for disaster forecasting and mitigation.

## Key Findings
- AI is increasingly being used to forecast natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods.
- Predictive analytics and machine learning models are improving disaster response efficiency.
- Ethical concerns around data privacy and reliability remain challenges for AI adoption in this field.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python (for data modeling and analysis)
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Sources:** Google Scholar, SpringerLink, and peer-reviewed journals
